This directory contains some resources from the course
[g53cfr](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/g53cfr/)
  -- **Computer Aided Formal Reasoning** by [Thorsten Altenkirch](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/)

Please see the course webpage for the full set of resources.

If for some reason you want to create a local mirror of the course webpage with
(hopefully) working links to all the resources, try uncompressing the
g53cfr.tar.gz tarball:

    tar xvzf g53cfr.tar.gz

Then load the index.html file into a browser.
